# Project PLUS
Project PLUS is my senior project for the Honors College at the University of Central Missouri. This app allows users to sign in either by creating an account or through Google & Facebook authentication. Users can create plans for group projects then flesh out a diagram organizing the project timeline. Users can add other users through email and link them to the project to help teams collaborate.

## Getting Started
You must have Node and NPM installed to access this application locally. Navigate to the project's server folder in your terminal and run the following command:
```
npm run dev
```
This will boot up the application in your preferred web browser.

## Built With
-React and Redux
-Node and Express
